## Usage

### Quantum Teleportation Simulator

The `QuantumTeleportationSimulator.py` script simulates the quantum teleportation process using Bell states and quantum communication protocols.

#### Example Usage
```python
# User input for the initial state
initial_state = input("Enter the initial state (0, 1, +, -): ")

# Simulate the quantum teleportation process
counts = simulate_quantum_teleportation(initial_state)
print("Teleportation Counts:", counts)
```

### Quantum Communication Protocol

The `QuantumCommunicationProtocol.py` script implements a quantum key distribution protocol using Bell states.

#### Example Usage
```python
# User input for the number of keys to generate
num_keys = int(input("Enter the number of keys to generate: "))

# Simulate the quantum key distribution process
keys = quantum_key_distribution(num_keys)

# Analyze the security of the generated keys
analyze_security(keys)

# Visualize the distribution of generated keys
visualize_keys(keys)
```

## Conclusion

The Pi-Powered Quantum Teleportation Data Channel feature provides a robust framework for the experimental development of a quantum teleportation data channel, enabling instant transaction information transfer across the Quantum Pi Network. This innovative approach leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to achieve ultra-low latency communication, paving the way for future advancements in secure and efficient data transfer methods.
