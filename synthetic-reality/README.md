# Synthetic Reality Integration

## Overview

The **Synthetic Reality Integration** feature connects Quantum Pi with synthetic worlds, such as the metaverse or other digital simulations. This allows Pi Coin to be used as a currency for buying, selling, or creating digital realities, enabling a seamless economic experience in virtual environments.

## Features

- **Unity SDK**: A set of scripts to integrate Pi Coin transactions into Unity applications, allowing developers to easily implement blockchain functionality in their games and experiences.
- **Unreal Engine SDK**: A plugin for Unreal Engine that facilitates Pi Coin transactions, providing a robust framework for developers to create immersive experiences in the metaverse.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work with various AR/VR platforms, ensuring that Pi Coin can be utilized across different virtual environments and applications.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/quantum-pi-network.git
   cd quantum-pi-network/synthetic-reality
   ```

2. **Unity SDK Installation**:
   - Import the `UnitySDK` folder into your Unity project.
   - In the Unity Editor, set the contract address and private key in the `PiCoinUnity.cs` script to connect to the Pi Coin smart contract.

3. **Unreal Engine SDK Installation**:
   - Add the `UnrealSDK` folder to your Unreal Engine project.
   - In the `PiCoinManager.cpp` file, set the contract address and private key to connect to the Pi Coin smart contract.

## Usage

### Unity Example
To use the Unity SDK, you can create a simple script to handle transactions:

```csharp
public class GameManager : MonoBehaviour
{
    private PiCoinManager piCoinManager;

    void Start()
    {
        piCoinManager = gameObject.AddComponent<PiCoinManager>();
        piCoinManager.SetContractAddress("YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS");
        piCoinManager.SetPrivateKey("YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY");
    }

    public void PurchaseItem(string itemId, decimal price)
    {
        piCoinManager.PurchaseItem(itemId, price);
    }
}
```

### Unreal Engine Example
To use the Unreal Engine SDK, you can create a simple actor to manage transactions:

```cpp
#include "GameManager.h"
#include "PiCoinManager.h"

void AGameManager::BeginPlay()
{
    Super::BeginPlay();

    PiCoinManager = NewObject<APiCoinManager>();
    PiCoinManager->SetContractAddress(TEXT("YOUR_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"));
    PiCoinManager->SetPrivateKey(TEXT("YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY"));
}

void AGameManager::PurchaseItem(FString ItemId, float Price)
{
    PiCoinManager->BuyItem(ItemId, Price);
}
```

## Conclusion

The Synthetic Reality Integration feature of the Quantum Pi Network empowers developers to create rich, immersive experiences in the metaverse by leveraging the power of blockchain technology. With the Unity and Unreal Engine SDKs, integrating Pi Coin transactions into virtual environments has never been easier.
