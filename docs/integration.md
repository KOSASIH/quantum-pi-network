# Integration with External Systems

## Overview
This document outlines the process for integrating the Quantum Pi Network with external systems, such as Stellar and other blockchain networks. Integration allows for enhanced functionality, including cross-chain transactions, data sharing, and interoperability.

## Supported Integrations
- **Stellar**: A blockchain network designed for fast and low-cost transactions.
- **Ethereum**: Integration with Ethereum-based assets and smart contracts.
- **Other Blockchains**: Future integrations with additional blockchain networks.

## Integration Steps

### 1. Setting Up the Environment
- Ensure you have the necessary API keys and access credentials for the external system.
- Update your `.env` file with the required configuration settings.

### 2. Using the Integration Service
- The integration service is located in `src/cross_chain/CrossChainService.js`.
- Import the service in your application:
  ```javascript
  1 const CrossChainService = require('./cross_chain/CrossChainService');
  ```

### 3. Making Cross-Chain Transactions
- Use the initiateTransaction method to start a transaction with an external blockchain.
  ```javascript
  1 const transactionResult = await CrossChainService.initiateTransaction({
  2     from: 'sourceAddress',
  3     to: 'destinationAddress',
  4     amount: 100,
  5     currency: 'XLM' // Example for Stellar
  6 });
  ```

### 4. Handling Callbacks
- Set up webhook endpoints to handle callbacks from the external system for transaction confirmations and status updates.

## Conclusion
Integrating with external systems enhances the capabilities of the Quantum Pi Network, allowing for a more versatile and powerful application. Follow the steps outlined above to set up and utilize these integrations effectively.
