# Decentralized Identity Management

## Overview
Decentralized identity management allows users to create, manage, and verify their identities without relying on a central authority. This enhances privacy, security, and user control over personal data.

## Key Features
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Users own and control their identity data.
- **Verifiable Credentials**: Users can share credentials that can be verified by third parties without revealing personal information.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Setting Up Identity Service
- The identity management service is located in `src/identity/IdentityService.js`.
- Import the service in your application:

  ```javascript
  1 const IdentityService = require('./identity/IdentityService');
  ```

### 2. Creating a New Identity
- Use the createIdentity method to create a new decentralized identity.

  ```javascript
  1 const newIdentity = await IdentityService.createIdentity({
  2     username: 'user123',
  3     email: 'user@example.com'
  4 });
  ```
  
### 3. Verifying Identity
- Use the verifyIdentity method to verify a user's identity.

  ```javascript
  1 const isVerified = await IdentityService.verifyIdentity(newIdentity.id);
  ```
  
### 4. Managing Credentials
- Users can issue and manage verifiable credentials through the identity service.

## Conclusion
Decentralized identity management empowers users with control over their personal data while enhancing security and privacy. Implement the steps above to integrate identity management into your application.
