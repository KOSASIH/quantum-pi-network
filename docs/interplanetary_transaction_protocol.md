# Interplanetary Transaction Protocol (ITP)

## Overview

The Interplanetary Transaction Protocol (ITP) is designed to facilitate secure and reliable transactions between planets, such as Earth and Mars. This protocol accounts for high latency and potential disruptions in communication, ensuring that transactions are processed efficiently and securely.

## Key Features

- **Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN)**: Handles communication delays and disruptions.
- **Transaction Management**: Manages the creation, processing, and validation of transactions.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling to ensure reliability.
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging.

## Code Implementation

### 1. Transaction Model

```python
from datetime import datetime
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, Float, Enum, ForeignKey
from sqlalchemy.orm import relationship
from app import db

class TransactionStatus(enum.Enum):
    PENDING = "pending"
    COMPLETED = "completed"
    FAILED = "failed"

class Transaction(db.Model):
    """Transaction model representing a financial transaction."""
    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    sender_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    receiver_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey('user.id'), nullable=False)
    amount = Column(Float, nullable=False)
    status = Column(Enum(TransactionStatus), default=TransactionStatus.PENDING)
    created_at = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)

    sender = relationship('User', foreign_keys=[sender_id])
    receiver = relationship('User', foreign_keys=[receiver_id])

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<Transaction {self.id} from {self.sender.username} to {self.receiver.username}>'
```

### 2. Transaction Processing Logic

```python
import logging
from app.models import Transaction, TransactionStatus
from app.dtn import DTNNode

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class TransactionProcessor:
    def __init__(self, dtn_node):
        self.dtn_node = dtn_node

    def create_transaction(self, sender_id, receiver_id, amount):
        """Create a new transaction."""
        if amount <= 0:
            logger.error("Transaction amount must be greater than zero.")
            raise ValueError("Transaction amount must be greater than zero.")

        transaction = Transaction(sender_id=sender_id, receiver_id=receiver_id, amount=amount)
        db.session.add(transaction)
        db.session.commit()

        logger.info(f"Transaction {transaction.id} created successfully.")
        self.dtn_node.send_message(transaction)

    def process_transaction(self, transaction):
        """Process the transaction and update its status."""
        try:
            # Simulate processing logic
            transaction.status = TransactionStatus.COMPLETED
            db.session.commit()
            logger.info(f"Transaction {transaction.id} processed successfully.")
        except Exception as e:
            transaction.status = TransactionStatus.FAILED
            db.session.commit()
            logger.error(f"Failed to process transaction {transaction.id}: {e}")
```

### 3. Delay-Tolerant Networking (DTN)

```python
import time
import random
import logging
from queue import Queue
from threading import Thread

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

class DTNNode:
    """Represents a node in the Delay-Tolerant Network."""
    
    def __init__(self, node_id):
        self.node_id = node_id
        self.message_queue = Queue()
        self.is_running = True
        self.thread = Thread(target=self.process_messages)
        self.thread.start()

    def send_message(self, message):
        """Send a message to the DTN."""
        logger.info(f"Node {self.node_id} sending message: {message}")
        self.message_queue.put(message)

    def process_messages(self):
        """Process messages in the queue with simulated delays."""
        while self.is_running:
            if not self.message_queue.empty():
                message = self.message_queue.get()
                self.simulate_network_conditions()
                self.deliver_message(message)
            time.sleep(1)  # Simulate processing time

    def simulate_network_conditions(self):
        """Simulate network conditions such as latency and packet loss."""
        latency = random.uniform(0.5, 2.0)  # Simulate latency between 0.5 to 2 seconds
        packet_loss = random.random()  # Randomly determine if the packet is lost

        if packet_loss < 0.1:  # 10% chance of packet loss
            logger.warning(f"Node {self.node_id} experienced packet loss.")
            return  # Simulate packet loss

        time.sleep(latency)  # Simulate network latency

    def deliver_message(self, message):
        """Deliver the message to the intended recipient."""
        logger.info(f"Node {self.node_id} delivered message: {message}")

    def stop(self):
        """Stop the DTN node."""
        self.is_running = False
        self.thread.join()
```

## Conclusion

The Interplanetary Transaction Protocol (ITP) is a sophisticated framework designed to handle the unique challenges of interplanetary transactions. By leveraging Delay-Tolerant Networking and robust transaction management, ITP ensures that transactions are processed reliably, even in the face of communication delays and disruptions. This implementation serves as a foundation for further enhancements and scalability in future interplanetary financial systems.
