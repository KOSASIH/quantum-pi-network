# Model Training for AI-Driven Dynamic Pegging Mechanism

In this notebook, we will train a machine learning model to predict the price of Pi Coin based on various features. We will use TensorFlow to build and train a neural network model.
```

```python
# Step 1: Import Libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```markdown
## Step 2: Load and Preprocess the Data
Let's load the preprocessed dataset and prepare it for training.
```

```python
# Load the preprocessed dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/processed/processed_data.csv')

# Separate features and target variable
X = data.drop('price', axis=1)  # Replace 'price' with your target variable name
y = data['price']  # Replace 'price' with your target variable name

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Standardize the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = scaler.transform(X_test)
```

```markdown
## Step 3: Build the Model
We will build a simple neural network model using TensorFlow.
```

```python
# Build a simple neural network model
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)  # Output layer for regression
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
```

```markdown
## Step 4: Train the Model
Let's train the model on the training data.
```

```python
# Train the model
history = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, validation_split=0.2, verbose=1)
```

```markdown
## Step 5: Evaluate the Model
After training, we will evaluate the model on the test set.
```

```python
# Evaluate the model on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Mean Squared Error on Test Set: {mse:.2f}")
```

```markdown
## Step 6: Visualize Training History
Let's visualize the training loss over epochs to understand the learning process.
```

```python
# Plot training history
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(history.history['loss'], label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(history.history['val_loss'], label='Validation Loss')
plt.title('Model Training Loss')
plt.xlabel('Epochs')
plt.ylabel('Loss')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

```markdown
## Step 7: Save the Model
Finally, we will save the trained model for future use.
```

```python
# Save the trained model
model.save('models/ai_model.h5')  # For TensorFlow
# Alternatively, for PyTorch, you would use:
# torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'models/ai_model.pth')
print("Model saved successfully.")
```

```markdown
## Conclusion
In this notebook, we trained a neural network model to predict the price of Pi Coin. The model's performance was evaluated using mean squared error, and the training history was visualized to understand the learning process. The trained model has been saved for future use.
