# Cosmic Identity Verification

## Overview

The **Cosmic Identity Verification** feature provides a unique authentication system based on cosmic fingerprints derived from cosmic background radiation and astronomical data. This approach allows for anonymous yet universally unique identity verification, making it suitable for intergalactic applications.

## Features

- **Anonymous Verification**: Users can authenticate without traditional personal data.
- **Cosmic Fingerprints**: Utilizes unique cosmic data for identity verification.
- **Integration with Astronomical Data**: Fetches data from observatories like NASA and ESA for verification processes.
- **Smart Contract**: Implements a secure on-chain identity verification system.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Web3.py
- Requests
- Solidity Compiler

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/quantum-pi-network.git
cd quantum-pi-network/cosmic-identity
```

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install Flask web3 requests
```

### Deploy the Smart Contract

Deploy the `CosmicIdentityVerification.sol` contract using a Solidity compiler or Remix IDE.

## Usage

### Running the Cosmic Identity API

To run the API, execute the following command:

```bash
python CosmicIdentityAPI.py
```

### Registering an Identity

Send a POST request to register a cosmic fingerprint:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/register-identity -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"cosmic_fingerprint": "YOUR_COSMIC_FINGERPRINT"}'
```

### Verifying an Identity

Send a POST request to verify a user's identity:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/verify-identity -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"user_address": "USER_ETH_ADDRESS"}'
```

### Fetching Cosmic Data

Send a GET request to fetch cosmic data from astronomical sources:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/fetch-cosmic-data
```

## Example

1. **Registering an Identity**: Users can register their cosmic fingerprints, which are stored on-chain for secure verification.
2. **Verifying an Identity**: Authorized verifiers can confirm the identity of users based on their cosmic fingerprints.
3. **Fetching Cosmic Data**: The API can fetch and return cosmic data from NASA and ESA, enriching the identity verification process.

## Conclusion

The Cosmic Identity Verification feature revolutionizes user authentication by leveraging cosmic data, ensuring anonymity while providing a unique identity verification method. This feature is a significant step towards a more secure and privacy-focused approach in decentralized applications.
