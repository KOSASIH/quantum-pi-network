# Dark Pool Decentralized Exchange (DEX)

## Overview

The **Dark Pool DEX** is a decentralized exchange that allows users to trade assets privately. It utilizes quantum encryption and zero-knowledge proofs to ensure the anonymity and integrity of transactions. This platform is designed to provide maximum privacy for institutional traders and large users, enhancing the liquidity of Pi Coin.

## Features

- **Order Placement**: Users can place buy and sell orders without revealing their intentions until execution.
- **Order Execution**: Orders can be executed by authorized parties, ensuring privacy.
- **Order Cancellation**: Traders can cancel their orders before execution.
- **Liquidity Management**: Placeholder functions for adding and removing liquidity.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Integration of zero-knowledge proofs to verify transactions without revealing sensitive information.

## Smart Contracts

### DarkPoolDEX.sol

The `DarkPoolDEX.sol` contract handles the core functionalities of the Dark Pool DEX, including:

- Placing orders
- Executing orders
- Canceling orders
- Managing liquidity

### ZeroKnowledgeProofs.sol

The `ZeroKnowledgeProofs.sol` contract implements a framework for zero-knowledge proofs, allowing for:

- Generation of proofs for transactions
- Verification of proofs without revealing sensitive data
- Event logging for proof generation and verification

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/quantum-pi-network.git
   cd quantum-pi-network/dark-pool-dex
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed. Then, install Hardhat and OpenZeppelin:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat @openzeppelin/contracts
   ```

3. **Compile the Smart Contracts**:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

## Usage

### Deploying the Smart Contracts

1. Create a deployment script in the `scripts` directory (e.g., `deploy.js`):
   ```javascript
   async function main() {
       const DarkPoolDEX = await ethers.getContractFactory("DarkPoolDEX");
       const darkPoolDEX = await DarkPoolDEX.deploy();
       await darkPoolDEX.deployed();
       console.log("Dark Pool DEX deployed to:", darkPoolDEX.address);
   }

   main()
       .then(() => process.exit(0))
       .catch((error) => {
           console.error(error);
           process.exit(1);
       });
   ```

2. Run the deployment script:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network yourNetwork
   ```

### Interacting with the Smart Contracts

1. **Placing an Order**:
   ```javascript
   await darkPoolDEX.placeOrder(100, 2000, true); // Place a buy order for 100 units at a price of 2000
   ```

2. **Executing an Order**:
   ```javascript
   await darkPoolDEX.executeOrder(orderId); // Execute the order with the specified orderId
   ```

3. **Canceling an Order**:
   ```javascript
   await darkPoolDEX.cancelOrder(orderId); // Cancel the order with the specified orderId
   ```

4. **Generating a Zero-Knowledge Proof**:
   ```javascript
   const proofHash = await zeroKnowledgeProofs.generateProof(dataHash); // Generate a proof for the given dataHash
   ```

5. **Verifying a Zero-Knowledge Proof**:
   ```javascript
   await zeroKnowledgeProofs.verifyProof(proofHash, dataHash); // Verify the proof against the original dataHash
   ```

## Example

```javascript
// Example of placing an order and generating a proof
const orderId = await darkPoolDEX.placeOrder(100, 2000, true);
const dataHash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(orderId, 100, 2000));
const proofHash = await zeroKnowledgeProofs.generateProof(dataHash);
```

## Conclusion

This implementation positions the Dark Pool DEX as a pioneering platform for private trading in the cryptocurrency space, adapting to the unique challenges of high-speed travel and exploration. The integration of zero-knowledge proofs enhances privacy and security, making it suitable for institutional traders and large users.
