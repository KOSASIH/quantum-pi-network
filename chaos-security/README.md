# Chaos Theory-Based Security Layer

## Overview

The **Chaos Theory-Based Security Layer** adds a robust security mechanism to the Quantum Pi Network by utilizing chaos theory to create unpredictable encryption patterns. This layer is designed to protect against AI and quantum attacks through extreme mathematical complexity, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of transactions.

## Features

- **Dynamic Pattern Generation**: Generates chaos-based encryption patterns using nonlinear dynamics.
- **Pattern Storage**: Stores multiple patterns for verification and historical reference.
- **Access Control**: Restricts certain functions to authorized users to enhance security.
- **Event Logging**: Emits events for pattern generation and verification for better tracking and transparency.
- **Gas Optimization**: Designed to minimize gas costs during transactions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KOSASIH/quantum-pi-network.git
   cd quantum-pi-network/chaos-security
   ```

2. **Deploy the Smart Contract**:
   - Ensure you have Hardhat installed and set up in your project.
   - Compile and deploy the `ChaosSecurityLayer.sol` contract using the following commands:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
   ```

3. **Run the Chaos Algorithm**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```
   - Run the chaos algorithm script:
   ```bash
   python ChaosAlgorithm.py
   ```

## Usage

### Smart Contract Functions

- **Generate Chaos Pattern**:
   ```solidity
   chaosSecurityLayer.generateChaosPattern(seed);
   ```
   - Generates a new chaos pattern based on the provided seed. Only the contract owner can call this function.

- **Verify Chaos Pattern**:
   ```solidity
   chaosSecurityLayer.verifyChaosPattern(id, pattern);
   ```
   - Verifies a given pattern against the stored chaos patterns by ID.

- **Retrieve Chaos Pattern**:
   ```solidity
   (bytes32 pattern, uint256 timestamp) = chaosSecurityLayer.getChaosPattern(id);
   ```
   - Retrieves a chaos pattern and its timestamp by ID.

- **Get Total Patterns**:
   ```solidity
   uint256 count = chaosSecurityLayer.getPatternCount();
   ```
   - Returns the total number of stored chaos patterns.

### Chaos Algorithm

The `ChaosAlgorithm.py` script generates a chaos sequence using the logistic map. You can adjust the parameters to explore different chaos behaviors.

#### Example Usage
```python
# Parameters for chaos generation
r = 3.9  # Parameter for chaos (should be in the range (3.57, 4) for chaos)
x0 = 0.5  # Initial condition
n = 100  # Number of iterations

# Generate the chaos sequence
chaos_sequence = generate_chaos_sequence(r, x0, n)

# Save the chaos sequence to a file
save_chaos_sequence(chaos_sequence, "chaos_sequence.csv")

# Plot the chaos sequence
plot_chaos_sequence(chaos_sequence)
```

## Conclusion

The Chaos Theory-Based Security Layer enhances the Quantum Pi Network's resilience against potential attacks by leveraging the principles of chaos theory. This innovative approach provides a strong foundation for secure transactions in the digital realm, making it a powerful tool for developers and users alike.
